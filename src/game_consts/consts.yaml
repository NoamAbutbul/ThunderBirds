# Game Rules
RULES: |
  The game starts with three lives per level.
  Each mistake in the game will result in the level restarting and one life being deducted.
  Each level has a certain time limit to complete the level.
  If the level is not completed within this time, it is considered a foul.

  Game Objects:
  - Big Ship
  - Small Ship
  - Block Numbers
  - Block Letters
  - Wall
  - Portal

  The goal is to reach the portal with both ships. The walls in the game cannot be moved.
  The ships can push blocks if their mass is greater than the block's mass.
  The big ship can push block letters, and the small ship can push block numbers.

  The mass of the block is determined by the number of pixels in the object.
  The big ship has 10 mass, and the small ship has 5 mass.

  If a block falls onto a ship and its mass is greater, it is considered a foul.
  However, if the block's mass is smaller than the current power of the ship, the block will move in the direction of the ship.

  If the external walls of the game have a hole on both sides of the board game limit,
  it will be an option to move from one side of the wall to the other.

  The game can be controlled using the following keys:
  - a: Move left
  - d: Move right
  - w: Move up
  - s: Move down
  - g: Switch ship
